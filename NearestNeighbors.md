# Nearest Neighbors Classifier

## Introduction
The nearest neighbors classifier is a simple yet powerful algorithm used in machine learning for classification tasks. It belongs to the family of instance-based or lazy learning algorithms, as it doesn't involve a training phase. Instead, it classifies new instances based on their similarity to existing instances in the training data.

## Basic Idea
The fundamental concept behind the nearest neighbors classifier is to assign a label to a new data point based on the labels of its nearest neighbors in the feature space. The assumption is that instances close in distance should belong to the same class.

## Algorithm Steps
1. **Training Phase:** In the training phase, the algorithm simply stores all the training instances along with their corresponding class labels. There is no explicit model building involved.

2. **Prediction Phase:** When a new instance needs to be classified, the algorithm calculates its similarity or distance to every instance in the training set. The class label of the new instance is then determined based on the labels of its nearest neighbors.

## Distance Metric
The choice of distance metric is crucial in nearest neighbors classification. Several distance metrics can be used depending on the nature of the data and the problem domain. Some commonly used distance metrics include:

### Euclidean Distance
Euclidean distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in a two-dimensional space is given by:
$$ \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} $$

### Manhattan Distance
Manhattan distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates:
$$ |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1| $$

### Minkowski Distance
Minkowski distance is a generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances and is defined as:
$$ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{i2} - x_{i1}|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} $$
where $p$ is a parameter. When $p = 2$, it becomes Euclidean distance, and when $p = 1$ , it becomes Manhattan distance.

### Chebyshev Distance
Chebyshev distance, also known as maximum metric, calculates the maximum absolute difference between the coordinates of two points:
$$ \max(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|) $$

### Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and is particularly useful for high-dimensional data or when the magnitude of the vectors is not important:
$$ \frac{{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}}{{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|}} $$

### Hamming Distance
Hamming distance calculates the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols differ between two strings of equal length. It's commonly used for categorical variables:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i \neq y_i) $$

### Jaccard Distance
Jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between two sets by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the union of the sample sets:
$$ 1 - \frac{{|X \cap Y|}}{{|X \cup Y|}} $$

### Correlation Distance
Correlation distance measures the dissimilarity between two vectors by calculating the correlation coefficient between them:
$$ 1 - \frac{{\text{cov}(X, Y)}}{{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}} $$

These are just a few examples of distance metrics used in nearest neighbors classification. The choice of distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the problem.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A variation of the nearest neighbors classifier is the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, where instead of considering only the single nearest neighbor, it considers the$k$nearest neighbors and makes the classification decision by majority voting among them.

## Conclusion
Nearest neighbors classifier is a simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks. It's particularly useful when the decision boundary is highly irregular or when dealing with small to medium-sized datasets. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets due to the need to calculate distances to all training instances.
